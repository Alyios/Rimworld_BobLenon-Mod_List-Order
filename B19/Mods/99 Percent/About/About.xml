Typically, deconstructing a building or facility refunds roughly 75% of the raw materials that went into building it.

This mod changes the game to refund you 99% of the resources that went into your constructions. The game has a hardcoded limitation that requires at least one material be lost in deconstruction.

[b]*[/b] If you build and deconstruct an item that costs 50 steel and 2 components, you will get back 49 steel and 1 component.


HUGE thanks to BrokenValkyrie on the Ludeon forums for showing me the right way and writing the patch.
